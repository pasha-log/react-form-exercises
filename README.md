# React Forms Exercises 

## Description: 

This was an exercise for practicing with React forms. The objective was to create two different forms. The first was for creating a box, accepting color and dimensions as parameters. The second was a todo list. Each item gets rendered on the page as an *li* element and can be deleted with their own **X** button.
